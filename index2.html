<h1>Anish's Fat foods</h1>
<p>Chicken Nuggets are one of my top foods but they have to be correctly made. Around 15-30 minutes after they come out of the oven is the best time to eat them, with ranch of course. My favorite food of all though is Chicken biriyani with paragu chatni.</p>

<h1>Anish's Portfolio</h1>
<p> My current portfolio consists of 100% NU Holding Shares. I do however have 200 dollars ready to invest from my birthday money to make more money for my portfolio to then put back into NU Holdings and other companies that I find interesting. </p>
